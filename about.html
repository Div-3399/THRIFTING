    In recent years, urban youth have been drawn towards practices that demand systemic changes in society, culture,
     production, and consumption. Many of them are exploring ways to shop fashion sustainably. One of the easiest ways 
     of indulging in sustainable fashion is through thrifting, i.e, purchasing second-hand apparel. Thrifting skips 
     multiple checkpoints of sustainability as new material need not be brought in, no additional manufacturing takes 
     place, no labour is required to make the clothes, no carbon is used up in transportation, no money is spent on
      marketing and so on. Thrifting simply extends the life of a preexisting garment and prevents it from ending up in 
      a landfill. It is an excellent way of keeping the garment in the market at the least possible environmental and
       social cost and a decent financial profit.

The youth, in particular, seem to be fond of thrifting. A reason for this could be lower prices of second-hand apparel 
as compared to fresh, sustainable fashion clothes. In India, too, the sudden spike in online thrift stores over the last 
few years is a telling sign of the demand for second-hand fashion. These stores (most of which are Instagram-based and
 some website-based) sell factory reject pieces, second-hand apparel (mainly imported from East-Asian countries) and even
  do closet clearances. The products include all manner of clothing such as high-waisted pants, formal shirts, party 
  dresses, lingerie and so on.

There also seems to be a shift in the way second-hand clothing is being perceived. In the Indian culture, second-hand 
products or hand-me-downs are understood to be need-based as it is generally assumed that anyone with the means would 
prefer to buy new rather than purchase second-hand clothes. However, this attitude seems to be gradually changing as 
more and more youngsters proudly showcase their thrifted fashion on their social media pages. Thrifting is now considered 
to be cool! The thrift store owners have been observing an overwhelming demand with their followers (mostly young college
 students or early career professionals), setting reminders to be the first on the social media page to snatch up the
  clothes quickly.
