       <p> What is sustainable fashion?<br>

In light of such negative externalities surrounding the fashion industry, sustainable fashion has emerged as the 
antidote to harmful fast fashion practices. Kate Fletcher, author and design activist, defines sustainable fashion 
as "fashion that fosters ecological integrity and social justice".  Though seemingly a straightforward definition, 
sustainable fashion can include many components such as environment-friendly manufacturing, use of recycled or natural
 raw materials, zero-waste or plastic-free packaging, circularity (a cradle-to-grave system), fair and transparent supply
  chain, fair wages and safe working conditions. Sustainable fashion also addresses issues of equity, diversity and 
  inclusivity.<br><br>

Critical sustainability<br>

Having established the meaning of sustainability, the concept of critical sustainability can guide the way forward. 
Critical sustainability is a theoretical framework that advocates for an inclusive public movement that actively resists 
private profit-making interests and privileges ecological integrity. It is also a form of sociopolitical and 
socioeconomic engagement deploying caste, class, gender, and race analyses of sustainability. While acknowledging the 
traditional pillars of sustainability known as the 3P's--planet, people and profit, critical sustainability takes on an
 equity-based approach wherein sustainability action caters to those who need it the most.

 Facts About Sustainable Fashion<br>
 To highlight the importance of sustainable fashion, here are some eye-opening facts:<br><br>
 
 Water Usage: It takes approximately 2,700 liters of water to produce a single cotton t-shirt. By choosing second-hand 
 clothing, you help conserve this precious resource.<br>
 Textile Waste: An estimated 92 million tons of textile waste is created annually. Thrifting helps reduce this waste
  and promotes a circular economy.<br>
 Carbon Emissions: The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions. By extending the life of 
 clothing, we can significantly reduce these emissions.<br>
 Resource Savings: Reusing clothes saves raw materials and energy, reducing the environmental impact associated with
  garment production.</p>
